## Hardware Prerequisites

### Common ###

Both the *WebVirt-Manager* and the *WebVirt-Node* require around 250mb (??) of hard disk space for installation, and a minimum of 256mb (??) of ram for basic operations.  An exact estimate of the memory requirements for the *WebVirt-Node* module is unavailable, because the total resource footprint will depend on the scale of the deployment being monitored.  The more libvirt hosts that are being kept track of, and the more instances on them, the more memory WebVirt will require.

Other than this, some sort of network interface must be available to the host machine and to the WebVirt application.
