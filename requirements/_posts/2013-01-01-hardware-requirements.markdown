## Hardware Prerequisites

### Common ###

Minimum:

*  250mb (??) HDD Space
*  256mb (??) RAM
*  Network interface

An exact estimate of the memory requirements for the *WebVirt-Node* module is unavailable, because the total resource footprint will depend on the scale of the deployment being monitored.  The more libvirt hosts that are being kept track of, and the more instances on them, the more memory WebVirt will require.
